Part B:

From my data I can gather that self-balancing trees have quick lookup times, but
slow insert times when compared to hash tables. On the other hand hash tables
have slow lookup times, but quick insert times when compared to trees.

For futher tests I may want to test different functions (such as pop) or test
their space efficiency. In other words test not only how fast each data type 
works but how much space it utilizes to store the same amount of items.
